## 🛠️ Built With Jekyll

This blog is powered by **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** — a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites.
Jekyll takes Markdown files and HTML templates and turns them into a complete, ready-to-publish static website.

Key features of Jekyll:

- 📦 Easy content creation using Markdown
- 🔄 Fast static site generation
- 🎨 Flexible theming and layout system
- 💻 Works seamlessly with **GitHub Pages**

If you're interested in creating your own blog with Jekyll, check out the [official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
