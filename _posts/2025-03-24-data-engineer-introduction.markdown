## What Does a Data Engineer Do?

Data Engineers are the **invisible architects** behind every successful data project. They design systems that transform raw data into actionable insights.

Data Engineers build the mission-critical infrastructure that powers:
- 🏗️ **Enterprise analytics platforms**
- 🤖 **Machine learning pipelines**
- 🌐 **Real-time data applications**

### Core Responsibilities:
- 🏗️ **Build scalable data pipelines** (ETL/ELT)
- 🗄️ **Manage data warehouses/lakes** (Snowflake, BigQuery)
- ⚡ **Enable real-time analytics** (Kafka, Spark Streaming)
- 🔐 **Ensure data security & compliance**

## Key Tools in 2025

| Category       | Tools                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Cloud**      | AWS, GCP, Azure               |
| **Big Data**   | Spark, Kafka, Airflow         |
| **SQL**        | PostgreSQL, Snowflake         |
| **DevOps**     | Docker, Terraform, CI/CD      |

## Why Data Engineering Matters Now

With global data creation projected to reach 200 zettabytes by 2025, organizations need:

- 🗄️ **Unified data access across regions**
- 📊 **Real-time retail analytics**
- 🤖 **ML infrastructure**
