Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a new concept. While its recent rise seems sudden, the idea of creating intelligent machines dates back centuries. This article takes you on a historical tour of AI—where it started, key milestones, and what the future may hold.

## 🏛️ Ancient Dreams of Thinking Machines

Long before computers, humans imagined artificial beings. In Greek mythology, **Hephaestus** crafted automatons, and **Pygmalion** fell in love with a statue brought to life. Ancient Chinese, Indian, and Arab texts also contain tales of mechanical beings.

Though mythological, these stories reflect humanity’s age-old fascination with replicating intelligence.

## 🧠 The Birth of Formal Thinking: Logic and Algorithms

In the 17th century, **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** envisioned a machine that could manipulate symbols logically, anticipating computational logic.

Later, **George Boole’s** symbolic logic (1847) and **Alan Turing’s** theoretical computer (1936) laid the mathematical foundations of AI.

## 🖥️ 20th Century: From Theory to Early AI

- **1950:** Alan Turing publishes _"Computing Machinery and Intelligence"_ proposing the famous Turing Test.
- **1956:** The term “Artificial Intelligence” is coined at the Dartmouth Conference by **John McCarthy**, **Marvin Minsky**, **Claude Shannon**, and others.
- **1960s-70s:** Symbolic AI thrives, using logic rules to mimic intelligence. Programs like ELIZA simulate conversation.

> 📌 Note: Early progress led to overconfidence—and two major “AI winters” where funding dried up due to unmet expectations.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Revolution

- **1980s:** Introduction of expert systems.
- **1997:** IBM’s Deep Blue defeats chess champion Garry Kasparov.
- **2000s-onward:** Explosion in data and computing power leads to Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning.

Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch help democratize AI development.

## 🧠 Modern AI & The Age of Transformers

Today, AI powers search engines, self-driving cars, recommendation systems, and chatbots. **Transformers**, introduced in 2017, revolutionized NLP—leading to models like **GPT**, **BERT**, and **Claude**.

## 🧭 What’s Next?

- **General AI (AGI):** AI that matches or exceeds human-level cognition.
- **Ethical & Responsible AI:** Growing focus on fairness, transparency, and avoiding bias.
- **Regulation & Governance:** Countries are developing frameworks to control AI’s impact.
